## Deep Learning Professional 

I am a final year master student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. I am a member of [Prof. Liang Pan's lab](https://sites.google.com/site/panliang/Members). 
My current research interest lies in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Right now I am focusing on a project of Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) on
iNaturalist Dataset with attention model. I am also interested in cutting-edge reinforcement learning/NLP technologies.   

Before came here, I was a research assistant in [Prof. Tao Liu's Lab](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liu8483), working on diffractive optics and 3D imaging microscopy. 
I managed to build a 3D structured illumination microscope([3D-SIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-resolution_microscopy#Structured_illumination_microscopy_(SIM))) 
to equip our dapartment on the detecting the surface properties of MEMS devices. Also, our work about a novel subwavelength objective lens, 
[multi-annular plates (MAPs)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2040-8978/17/3/035610), was published in the Journal of Optics.
