# Hello! 

I was born and grew up in a small mountain town, [Xixia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xixia_County). 
I spent four years at [Xi'an, Shannxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an), and obtained my Bachelor 
degree at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University)(2012-2016). 
Now, I am a master student in mechanical engineering at [Purdue University](www.purdue.edu), concentrating on 
Deep Learning and Computer Vision.    

I play basketball as a three point shooter. I am also a huge fun of Cleveland Cavaliars and Lebron James. 
In my spare time, I enjoy immersing myself in science fictions. My favorite novel series is 
[Galactic Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(series)) by Isaac Asimov. I am also an amateur
bodybuilder and powerlifter.
